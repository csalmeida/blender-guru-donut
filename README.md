# Blender Guru Donut

This project was created by following [Andrew Price's Blender tutorial for beginners course](https://youtu.be/nIoXOplUvAw).

It includes:

- A Blender file with the models, composition and animation (`blender_guru_donut.blend`).
- A second Blender file used for video editing and rendering (`blender_guru_donut_video.blend`).
- A `/textures` folder that includes the donut base texture.
- A `/references_images` folder with images that were used to make the donut.
- A `render` folder which includes all the frames and video files of exported work.
